## How Do I Love Thee
> *written by Elizabeth Barrett Browning*
> 

How do I love thee?

Let me count the ways.

<!--more-->

I love Thee to the depth and breath and height my Soul can reach, 
when feeling out of Sight, for the ends of Being and ideal Grace.

I love thee to the level of everyday's Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.

I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;

I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.

I love thee with the Passion put to use in my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.

I love thee with a love I seemed to lose with my lost saints,

I love thee with the breath, smiles, tears, of all my life 

and, if God choose, I shall but love thee better after death.
