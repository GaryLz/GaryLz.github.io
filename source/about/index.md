Hello, Lucky one,
    welcome to my blog. 
    
    I'm Gary, a student from China.
    
    The very frist of impulse I setting up this site, is to *sharing* something with myself.(i.e.learning, thoughts, ideas, and moods).

    In some ways, letting you knows a little about me, even though you didn't know me at all. Whatsoever, just pretend that it's for one guy to talk to himself like a diary.

    It's worth recording, especially for myself.
    Anyway, just like a quote I give to myself, Keep curious just like a child.

大家好，
    
    想必大家可能知道我是谁。
    欢迎大家来到我的博客。/骄傲脸 

    建立这个博客，前前后后折腾了大概大半年时间。
    之所以建立这个博客，是因为如今生活太过嘈杂焦虑。想有个地方，时常安静地写些东西，无聊低落时随时随地都可以看到——原来自己也挺不错。/毕竟自己内心还是个喜好安静的人。

    在这里，我时常分享一些关于自己的一些杂七杂八。（更多地关于学习的总结。）
    一个记录自己一点一滴的小站。

                                                              night, Apr.3rd,19
