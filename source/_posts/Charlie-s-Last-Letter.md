## Charlie's Last Letter

>from MOVIE *The Perks Of Being A Wallflower*


I don't know if I will have the time to write any more letters.

Because I might be too busy trying to paticipate.

<!--more-->


So, it this does end up being the last letter.

I just want to tell you that 

I was in a bad place before I started high school

And you helped me.

Even if you didn't know what I was talking about 

or know someone who's gone through it

And it made me not feel alone.

Because I know there're people 

who say all these things don't happen

there're people 

*who forget what it's like to be 16
when they turn 17.*

I know these will be all stories someday,

And our picutures will become old photograph,s

And we all will become someone's mom or dad.

But right now,

these moments are not stories.

This is happening.

I'm here, 

and I'm looking at her.

And she's so beautiful.

...

I can see it,

the one moment when you know you are not a sad stories,

You're alive.

And you stand up and look at the lights on the building

and everything that makes you wonder.

And you were listening to that song on that drive with people you love most in this world.

And in this moment,

I swear,

We are infinite.
